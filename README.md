# SETUP

If you haven't setup a python virtual enviroment prior to this, the process is as follows:

1. Install python3 if you don't have it yet
2. Open a command line, go to where you've cloned the repository, and run ```python3 -m venv venv``` (it's usually called venv but you can change the second one to name it another way)
3. Run in that same cmd ```source venv/bin/activate``` then ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. Now you should be able to run the code properly by doing ```python3 main.py```
